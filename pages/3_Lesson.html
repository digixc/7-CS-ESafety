<i>If a friend tells you something that worries you:</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Don’t judge them, just listen.</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Try not to put words into your friend’s mouth or tell them what they are feeling.</li>
<li>Let them tell you what’s going on.</li>
<li>Listen and support them.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Tell them that if you think they’re in danger you will seek help.</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don’t promise to keep secrets. No secret which will hurt someone is worth keeping.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Tell an adult you trust about what has happened.</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This could be your parent/carer, teacher, youth worker, police of cer, doctor or social worker.</li>
<li>Ask them to get help for your friend.</li>

<p>
<b>You can report what has happened to CEOP yourself, or do it with your friend.</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do this by clicking on ClickCEOP button at thinkuknow.co.uk</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Get support for yourself.</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You probably feel very anxious about what your friend has told you. You too need support to deal with what has happened.</li>
<li>Talk to an adult you trust about how you are feeling. You might it helpful to talk to a counsellor: you could ask your teacher or doctor to refer you to a counselling service.</li>
<li>Remember, you can call Childline to talk to someone at any time of day or night on 0800 1111.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Don't take it all on yourself</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Be realistic about the situation. You might have done all the right things, but you still might not be able to help your friend.</li>
<li>Remember, what has happened is not your fault and you have done your best to get help. Make sure you are getting the support you need yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>What if you think there’s something wrong but they haven’t said anything yet?</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you’re worried about a friend, don’t be afraid to tell them so. Even if they don’t want to talk, let them know you’re always there to listen.</li>
