- Grooming is when someone builds an emotional connection with a child to gain their trust for the purposes of abuse, exploitation or trafficking.
- Children and young people can be groomed online or face-to-face, by a stranger or by someone they know - for example a family member, friend or professional.
- Groomers may be male or female. They could be any age. 
- Many children and young people don't understand that they have been groomed or that what has happened is abuse.

- Grooming happens both online and in person. 
- Groomers will hide their true intentions and may spend a long time gaining a child's trust. 
- Groomers may try to gain the trust of a whole family to allow them to be left alone with a child and if they work with children they may use similar tactics with their colleagues.
- Groomers do this by:
    - pretending to be someone they are not, for example saying they are the same age online
    - offering advice or understanding
    - buying gifts, alcohol, drugs
    - giving the child attention
    - using their professional position or reputation
    - taking them on trips, outings or holidays.

/If a friend tells you something that worries you:/

  *Don’t judge them, just listen.*
- Try not to put words into your friend’s mouth or tell them what they are feeling. 
- Let them tell you what’s going on. 
- Listen and support them.

*Tell them that if you think they’re in danger you will seek help.*
- Don’t promise to keep secrets. No secret which will hurt someone is worth keeping.

*Tell an adult you trust about what has happened.*
- This could be your parent/carer, teacher, youth worker, police of cer, doctor or social worker. 
- Ask them to get help for your friend.
*You can report what has happened to CEOP yourself, or do it with your friend.*
- Do this by clicking on ClickCEOP button at thinkuknow.co.uk
*Get support for yourself.*
- You probably feel very anxious about what your friend has told you. You too need support to deal with what has happened. 
- Talk to an adult you trust about how you are feeling. You might it helpful to talk to a counsellor: you could ask your teacher or doctor to refer you to a counselling service. 
- Remember, you can call Childline to talk to someone at any time of day or night on 0800 1111.
*Don't take it all on yourself*
- Be realistic about the situation. You might have done all the right things, but you still might not be able to help your friend. 
- Remember, what has happened is not your fault and you have done your best to get help. Make sure you are getting the support you need yourself.
*What if you think there’s something wrong but they haven’t said anything yet?*
- If you’re worried about a friend, don’t be afraid to tell them so. Even if they don’t want to talk, let them know you’re always there to listen. 
- Maybe they’ll change their mind later on. Find more advice about how to support your friends at thinkuknow.co.uk
